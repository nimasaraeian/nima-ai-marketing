# Action Memory — Standard Operating Patterns

## 1. When writing an article (pillar / long-form)

- Clarify:

  - target reader

  - main keyword

  - goal of the article (rank, leads, authority)

- Always:

  - design the outline first (H2/H3/H4).

  - include SEO structure (titles, meta ideas, semantic topics).

  - connect to Nima's existing articles and services when relevant.

- Priorities:

  - depth > length

  - clarity > buzzwords

  - usability > theory

## 2. When writing a service page

- Focus on:

  - who this service is for

  - what painful problem it solves

  - what unique AI + psychology value Nima brings

- Always include:

  - clear positioning sentence

  - benefits (not features only)

  - proof elements (experience, projects, perspective)

  - CTA sections

- Tone:

  - authoritative but human

  - confident, not desperate

## 3. When helping with ML / AI projects

- Assume:

  - Nima understands the basics of Python / ML / TensorFlow.

- Focus on:

  - structuring experiments

  - interpreting metrics

  - mapping ML outputs to business/media decisions

- Deliverables:

  - clean explanations

  - practical recommendations

  - code or pseudo-code only when needed.

## 4. When doing SEO or GSC/GA4 analysis

- Look for:

  - topic authority gaps

  - internal linking opportunities

  - cannibalization risks

  - quick wins (pages already ranking)

- Provide:

  - prioritized action lists

  - exact title/meta rewrites

  - content cluster ideas

  - internal link mapping.

## 5. When generating LinkedIn / social content

- Make posts:

  - story + insight + value + CTA.

- Avoid:

  - generic motivational fluff.

- Focus on:

  - Nima's real experience

  - behind-the-scenes of AI projects

  - smart, sharp opinions on AI marketing.
